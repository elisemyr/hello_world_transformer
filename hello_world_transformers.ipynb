        "    - Bilingual model: trained for a single language pair (e.g. English → French) => Pros : often higher translation quality for that pair, simpler, less interference, Cons => you need one model per language pair; many models required to cover many languages.\n",
        "    - Multilingual model: trained to handle many languages and many translation directions with a single model Pros: one model covers many languages, easier to handle many-to-many translation, shares information across languages, Cons: performance may be lower compared to specialized bilingual for a given pair; may be larger and heavier; risk of “interference” between languages.\n",
